# Color Chart

A non-material and classified color chart for Flutter development.

Flutter officially provides the
[Material Color System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview)
which you can simply call the `material` library.
But that's not the only option.
This package provides a non-material and classified color chart for Flutter.
All the colors are named by common items and are easy to remember,
and they are also classified into smaller groups according to their styles.

This package also provides some utils about the `Color`.
